Manipulate C Intermediate Language ASTs with CIL

This tool performs a number of operations on CIL ASTs parsed from C
source files.

      ids | prints the total number of statements
   number | numbers each statement
   delete | deletes that numbered statement
   insert | copies the second numbered statement before the first
     swap | swaps the two numbered statements

Installation
